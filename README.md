Practice
Hello World, my name is Amro. And I'm learning to use Github. I'm still cocnfused as to why all of this is better than making it on my computer? But maybe it's faster than having to keep separate folders for all of this stuff? We shall see.
Actually if this works, I hope this would let me and Dr. Ahmed work on different versions of the model at different times.
